# rpn_calculator_std
An RPN Calculator written using Elixir Phoenix LiveView

This is a clone of [rpn_calculator](https://github.com/svenvc/rpn_calculator) 
that uses the standard Phoenix LiveView [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/)
component library based on [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
instead of the commercial component library [Fluxon UI](https://fluxonui.com) used in the original.

To start your Phoenix server:

* Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
* Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
