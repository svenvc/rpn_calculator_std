# rpn_calculator_std
An RPN Calculator written using Elixir Phoenix LiveView

This is a clone of [rpn_calculator](https://github.com/svenvc/rpn_calculator) 
that uses the standard Phoenix LiveView [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/)
component library based on [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
instead of the commercial component library []() used in the original.
